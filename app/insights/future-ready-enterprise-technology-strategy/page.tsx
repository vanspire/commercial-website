                    The strategic disalignment problem
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    Organisations routinely invest significantly in technology strategy exercises -
                    workshops, external consultants, roadmap documents, governance frameworks -
                    only to find that two or three years later, the strategy requires fundamental
                    revision. Not because the business changed more than expected, but because
                    the strategy was never genuinely aligned with where the business needed to go.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This strategic disalignment has a consistent cause: technology strategies that
                    are built around current technical capabilities rather than future business
                    requirements. They optimise for what exists, rather than enabling what needs
                    to exist. They answer the question &quot;how do we improve what we have?&quot; when
                    the more important question is &quot;what capabilities do we need to build?&quot;
                  </p>

                  <h2 className="text-[clamp(1.4rem,2.5vw,2rem)] font-light tracking-[-0.03em] text-brand-black mt-10 mb-4">
                    What &quot;future-ready&quot; actually requires
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    Future-readiness in enterprise technology is not a product you can buy or a
                    certification you can achieve. It is an organisational state characterised by
                    several specific capabilities:
                  </p>
                  <ul className="space-y-4 my-6">
                    {[
                      { t: 'Architectural adaptability', d: 'The ability to change systems - to add capabilities, integrate new tools, or replace components - without programmes of work measured in years rather than months.' },
                      { t: 'Data accessibility', d: 'The ability to answer new business questions from existing data, without extensive engineering work to extract, transform, or reconcile information trapped in siloed systems.' },
                      { t: 'Deployment velocity', d: 'The ability to release changes to production reliably and frequently - not constrained to quarterly release windows or requiring multi-team coordination for routine updates.' },
                      { t: 'Skill portability', d: 'Technology choices that allow the business to hire from a broad talent pool, rather than depending on specialists in proprietary or declining technologies.' },
                      { t: 'Vendor independence', d: 'Architecture that minimises lock-in to specific platforms, vendors, or tools whose strategic direction may not align with yours.' },
                    ].map((item) => (
                      <li key={item.t} className="flex items-start gap-3">
                        <div className="w-1 h-1 rounded-full bg-brand-muted mt-[12px] flex-shrink-0" />
                        <span><strong className="font-medium text-brand-black">{item.t}:</strong> {item.d}</span>
                      </li>
                    ))}
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Organisations that have these capabilities consistently outperform those that
                    do not - not because they are better at predicting the future, but because they
                    are better at responding to it.
                  </p>

                    The horizon model for technology planning
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    One of the most useful frameworks for enterprise technology strategy is horizon
                    planning - dividing technology initiatives into three distinct horizons based
                    on time and certainty:
                  </p>

                  <h3 className="text-[18px] font-medium text-brand-black mt-8 mb-3">Horizon 1: Operate and improve (0–18 months)</h3>
                  <p>
                    These are the initiatives that maintain and incrementally improve what already
                    exists. System reliability, performance improvements, security patching, user
                    experience refinements. High certainty, high urgency, directly tied to current
                    operational outcomes. Most organisations over-invest here at the expense of the
                    other horizons, trading long-term capability for short-term stability.
                  </p>

                  <h3 className="text-[18px] font-medium text-brand-black mt-8 mb-3">Horizon 2: Extend and scale (18 months–3 years)</h3>
                  <p>
                    These are initiatives that extend current capabilities into adjacent areas or
                    build the foundations for foreseeable business evolution. API platform development.
                    Data infrastructure modernisation. Cloud migration programmes. Team capability
                    building. Medium certainty, medium urgency. These initiatives are almost always
                    underinvested because their value is not immediately visible and their benefits
                    accrue to leadership that may not currently be in post.
                  </p>

                  <h3 className="text-[18px] font-medium text-brand-black mt-8 mb-3">Horizon 3: Explore and position (3+ years)</h3>
                  <p>
                    These are low-certainty, potentially high-value explorations of technologies
                    or capabilities that may become strategically important. AI integration, next-generation
                    infrastructure patterns, new market technology requirements. Small investments
                    that maintain strategic optionality rather than commitment. The goal is not
                    prediction - it is ensuring the organisation is not discovering these capabilities
                    from a standing start when the market requires them.
                  </p>

                  <h2 className="text-[clamp(1.4rem,2.5vw,2rem)] font-light tracking-[-0.03em] text-brand-black mt-10 mb-4">
                    The governance question most strategies avoid
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    Technology strategy is only as durable as the governance mechanisms that
                    maintain it. Most technology roadmaps are created, presented, and then gradually
                    abandoned as operational pressures accumulate and the original sponsors move
                    on. What makes a strategy future-ready is not the quality of its initial
                    articulation - it is the quality of the processes that keep it relevant over time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Effective technology governance typically requires three things that are structurally
                    difficult to maintain: consistent executive sponsorship with genuine accountability,
                    regular review cadences that update the strategy as business conditions change,
                    and investment decisions that are made against strategic criteria rather than
                    departmental lobbying.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Organisations that treat technology governance as bureaucratic overhead consistently
                    accumulate strategic debt in the same way that poorly governed engineering
                    organisations accumulate technical debt. The mechanism is different. The outcome
                    is similar.
                  </p>

                  <h2 className="text-[clamp(1.4rem,2.5vw,2rem)] font-light tracking-[-0.03em] text-brand-black mt-10 mb-4">
                    Building the capability, not just the plan
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    The most durable technology strategies we have seen are not documents - they
                    are capability-building programmes. The strategy defines the target state:
                    the architectural patterns to adopt, the data capabilities to develop, the
                    engineering practices to establish. The ongoing governance maintains alignment
                    as conditions change. And the investment portfolio ensures resources are
                    allocated across horizons rather than consumed entirely by the immediate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Future-readiness is built, not planned. It is accumulated through hundreds of
                    consistent technical decisions made within a clear strategic context. The role
                    of the strategy is to provide that context - and to be maintained well enough
                    that it remains relevant when those decisions are being made.
                  </p>
